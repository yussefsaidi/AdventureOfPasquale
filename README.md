# Adventure Of Pasquale - Video Game Prototype

This is a video game prototype my team and I created from the ground up. It was tested by around 40 people.

## Getting Started

To get this running on your own machine, you simply need to download all of the files, put them in a folder, and double click the Adventure of Pasquale.exe file.

### Prerequisites

Winrar or other software to unzip folder.

### Installation

Simply download the archive of all the files, unzip them into an accessible location. Double click and launch "Adventure Of Pasquale.exe". You will then get this screen:
